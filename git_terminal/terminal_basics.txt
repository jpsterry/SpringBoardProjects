the terminal is the text interface we use, the shell is the execution environment

an absolute path is directions from the root dir

a relative path is directions relative to the current dir

a flag is a way of passing in extra commands into an operation ex. -a for all files, -r for recursive removal, -f for forced removal

-r removes every file in a folder recursively then it deletes the folder.  -f will force remove the file and ignore any non-existent files without displaying a prompt
